### `installation`

### `npm install`
Clone the project and navigate to expo_app_master directory in the terminal and then run the following code.
```
npm install
# or
yarn install
```
### `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.
```
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

#### `npm run ios`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

#### `npm run android`
